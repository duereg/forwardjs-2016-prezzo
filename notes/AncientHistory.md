Ancient History (4min)

Brandan Eich created JS in 1995, famously in two weeks

### ES3

### ES4

After work was started on ES4, that continued for 7 years

Adobe Flash / Microsoft Silverlight

Chris Wilson and Microsoft posts some naughty blogs

 - language too big
 - committee not listening to anyone
 - committee forcing new language on everyone
 - MS is poor victim

JS should be "small, elegant language" aka don't change it

### Imagine Brandan Eich comes home to read these blog posts
- flame war picture 1
- call bullshit

"So Iâ€™ll expect to see no more of these lies spread by you."

oh snap!

Some concepts developed in ES4 are now part of ES6/ES2015

"Significant work was done to develop a fourth edition of ECMAScript. However, that work was not completed and not published as the fourth edition of ECMAScript but some of it was incorporated into the development of the sixth edition."


The PR that signalled the end of node.js as we know it:

https://github.com/joyent/libuv/pull/1015

"won't merge this type of trivial change"

Ben closes PR
Isaas reopened and merges
Ben reverts change

Joyent CEO says "Ben Noordhuis doesn't work for Joyent, but if did, he'd be fired"
